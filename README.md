## Improvements ideas

- Add translation system to manage at least **english** and **french**
- Better manage proptypes. For the moment, sneaker proptypes doesn't respect DRY concept
- Improve e2e testing by running them CI-side and from multiple browsers (Firefox, Edge...Â°
- Add a function to sort sneakers by brand
- Add a new cool search functionnality. User will be able to find a specific sneaker and by redirected to the sneaker page. This functionnality is very hot and should be accessible everywhere so it could be a good idea to put it inside the Header component
- Improve UI! I have very cool idea about the UI to make the two pages completely insane. I'll be happy to discuss with you about these ideas.
- Add frontend cache mechanics to cache data requested. Use something like [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/) could be a good idea
- Add backend tests and integration tests

I've cool ideas to share with you, I'll be happy to discuss them.

Thanks to the team at Wethenew for their time. I have made clear-cut technical and design decisions (_Why using serverless functions? Why don't add any dependencies? Why create the UI from scratch? Why this file structures choice..._) and so I will be happy to share my thoughts about his choices with you during a phone call.
